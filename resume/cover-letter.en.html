    <h2>tl;dr</h2>

    <p>
        Since I was a child I have always been interested in every type of electronic devices and in their "mysterious functioning",<br>
        I had always tried to understand what was hidden behind it and why.

    <p>👦🏻 Over the years, these interests have grown with me:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>At the age of 6, Santa gave me my first computer along with a cell phone;</li>
        <li>Since 2005, I am a Microsoft Insider (beta tester);</li>
        <li>At 19, I developed my first firmware for a Symbian S60 device;</li>
        <li>In 2016, with my team, We won the first Italian-hackathon in Ravenna;</li>
        <li>In 2018, I graduated and certified "Google MWS", coming as one in the top 1000 developers (selected from over 200,000 candidates).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>💪🏻 Due to my past experiences, i've built my own way-to-work:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I am able to communicate clearly and precisely, responding to customers and users;</li>
        <li>I am able to organize my work autonomously, setting priorities and deadlines; even in stressful situations;</li>
        <li>And due to my personality, I am able to relate to people of different cultures and nationalities;</li>
    </ul>
